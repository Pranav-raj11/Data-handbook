**Important Notes About Running Queries**

* End each SQL statement with a semicolon (\;). This tells SQL that the current statement is complete.  
* When you run a script, MySQL Workbench only executes the statement your cursor is currently inside (or the text you have highlighted).  
  * If your cursor is on the second line, only that statement will run, not the entire file.  
* To run all queries in the file, highlight them all first, then click the Execute button (⚡).  
* For this project, you can do all the learning queries in 1 tab if you’d like, however, do the exercises in separate tabs where stated.
