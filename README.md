# Making this book your own
This repo contains most of the necessary parts of a Jupyter-book (configured for GLOCAL usage) - I've included a few sample parts and chapters as a starting point. Sample Part 3 Chapter 3 is probably my best example of 'good' markdown usage - so use it as a reference sheet if you'd like.

## What to Change:
- SAMPLE_README.md lines 1, 3, 4, 5 (also rename to just README.md)
- CONTRIBUTING.md lines 28, 29, 45, 56
- deploy.yml (if publishing) lines 27, 32, 33, 38
- glocal-book-template folder name
- glocal-book-template/_config.yml lines 8, 9, 29
- glocal-book-template/conf.py lines 6, 31,
